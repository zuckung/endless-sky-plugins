### combat.ai
<br>
<br>
Offers a mission to install a combat AI, which increases your ship stats based on combat experience.<br>
<br>
You can get the mission to install the AI on any human planet.<br>
Every 3,000 combat xp you can choose between 8 basic updates, every 7,000 between 7 advanced updates, and every 11,000 between 14 special updates.<br>
Some updates have max ranks and others can get raised infinitely. These updates are done by adding invisible outfits with stats to the ship.<br>
If you change your ship or lose the unique combat AI outfit, a restoring mission installs everything that has been lost on the (new) ship.<br>
Some mechanics and ideas are inspired by Zoura's excellent plugin "Tales of Apoxys DX" . My plugin is less complex, doesn't needs a fresh start, and is more flexible.<br>
