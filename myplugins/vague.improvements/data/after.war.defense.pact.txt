		conversation
			`You can't help noticing that the freighter parked next to the <ship> is in very bad shape, its hull pockmarked with blaster scars, as well as larger dents that may be from missiles. The crew and a number of men in militia uniforms are busy welding new hull plating onto it; the captain is having an animated conversation with a young female militia officer.`
			choice
				`	(Approach them and find out what happened.)`
				`	(Ignore them.)`
					decline
			`	You overhear enough of the conversation to figure out that the freighter was attacked by pirates, and the militia are helping to get it in working condition again. "A little spit shine and it'll look as good as new," the officer says, but the captain of the ship doesn't look convinced and walks up to his ship to work on it alongside the crew.`
			`	The militia officer glances over her shoulder and, having spotted you listening in, waves you over. "No need to be shy," she says. "I'm guessing you're not from around here."`
			choice
				`	"How can you tell?"`
				`	"Are the pirates rough around these parts?"`
					goto pirates
			`	"Because captains from around here don't rubberneck at an every-day occurrence. After seeing your first dozen or so damaged ships, you eventually get used to seeing them and just move on."`
			`	"Are the pirates rough around these parts?" you ask.`
			label pirates
			`	"Rougher than you're probably used to if you're from farther up north. The Navy doesn't patrol these parts, not unless there's some high profile warlord that's on their radar. Because of that, pirates have more free rein to terrorize us down here." She pauses for a moment while turning back to the freighter. "And the pirate fleets keep getting stronger every year," she says with concern.`
			choice
				`	"Is there something I can do to help?"`
				`	"I wish I could help, but my ship is not a warship."`
					goto warship
			`	"There is indeed," she says. "Have you heard of the Southern Mutual Defense Pact?"`
				goto pact
			label warship
			`	"There are other ways you could help us," she says. "Have you heard of the Southern Mutual Defense Pact?"`
			label pact
			choice
				`	"No. What is it?"`
				`	"Yes."`
					goto eyes
			`	She says, "We're a collection of worlds that have decided that since the Navy doesn't patrol this part of the galaxy anymore, it's up to us to keep the pirates in check. The idea is that if the pirates ever try something big, like capturing an entire planet, that planet can call on the entire Pact to assist them. And, as you can see, we also do our fair share of helping out the local merchants where we can."`
			`	"Sounds like a good idea," you say.`
			label eyes
			`	"The Pact is launching a new initiative, led by myself," she says. "We're calling it the 'Thousand Eyes.' We're asking merchant ship captains to let us access their scanner logs, basically using merchants as a surveillance network. You don't have to fight the pirates, just let us know if you see them. Interested?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure, I would be glad to help."`
				`	"Sorry, sounds too risky."`
					decline
			`	"Great!" she says. "Right now, we need more eyes on a few systems on the edge of Southern space. All you need to do is fly through those systems, then report to our base on <destination>. I'll mark the target systems on your ship's map for you. And by the way, the name's Freya Winters."`
			`	"<first> <last>," you respond, shaking her hand.`
			`	"Nice to meet you, Captain <last>. Glad to have another helping hand. I'll be heading to <planet> after I've finished my business on <origin>, so see you there."`
