	description `Pluto was the site of the horrendous costly "Deep Space Amusement Park" of CosmoY Megacorp. The 5-stars "Restaurant at the End of the Solar System" alone did cost a billion credits. Opened just the day before the first hyperdrive was presented to the public, it became the biggest commercial failure of all time in the human tourism industry. The immediate bankruptcy of CosmoY left several hundred of the company's employees stranded.`
	description `	When a rescue mission arrived about 11 years later, no one was found on the deserted site, neither alive nor dead. Only a mysterious message, hastily written with ketchup on the canteen's window - "The Quark saved us". Till today hobby detectives try to find out, why of all things a German dairy product was the last the poor souls thought of, when they went crazy.`
