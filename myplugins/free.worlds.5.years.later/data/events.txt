		spaceport `The Navy officers who are in charge here have no time for anyone who is not enlisted in the Navy and participating in the ongoing investigation.`

	planet "Martini"
		description `Martini is a world of exotic beaches and perfect weather. The Republic's central bank and the Galactic Stock Exchange were previously headquartered here, before a terrorist attack destroyed them and a large portion of the capital city as well.`
		description `	Currently, a massive rescue and evacuation operation is underway in and around the capital to find and treat survivors and contain the radiation. As to be expected, the planet's supplies are running dangerously low, and what remains of Martini's government has called for civilian ships to help deliver goods and provisions for the operation.`
		spaceport `Instead of the immaculate spaceport that Martini once sported, this temporary spaceport consists of randomly-scattered makeshift landing areas, in order to support the large number of Navy and civilian ships assisting with the rescue and evacuation operation.`

	planet "Bourne"
		description `Bourne is a well-developed industrial world that was first settled four centuries ago. Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet.`
		description `	Outside the cities, the climate is somewhat dry, but the deep valleys and some coastal regions are suitable for farming. Very little of the planet remains that is untouched by human hands.`
		description `	Bourne is also the seat of government for the newly-formed Free Worlds.`

	planet "Ingot"
		description `Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings.`
		description `Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong.`
		description `Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit.`

		description `New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals.`
		description `Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small.`
		description `The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales. So far, it's just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies.`

		description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight.`
		description `	The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies. The sapphires range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color and are used for industrial abrasives and jewelry.`
		description `	For centuries the locals have tried to find a deposit of diamonds, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
		description `	The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers.`
