# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small, modular and maximal compatible plugins that don't break vanilla lore too much. <br>
Please excuse bad English, spelling, grammar, etc... English isn't my mother tongue. Feel free to correct me.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/pulls">Pull requests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/discussions">discussions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/issues">Issue reports</a> are welcome! <br>
<br>
Furthermore, I'd like to present <a href="https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/">https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/</a> to other plugin creators or people who seek information inside the data folder. Basically it is a very fast website to view every object of the data folder, especially when you don't know where to find something. For an easier browsing and comparing of game objects, like missions, ships, systems, and others.<br>

<br>
<br>
If you are familiar with Python, the scripts in the <a href="tools/README.md">tools-folder</a> might be interesting. There are a few to generate some of my plugins (to keep them up-to-date). And others like an ES jpg map creator or a PR files downloader.<br>
<br>
I've got another new project, a github repository that lets you online generate a galaxy with up to 500 star systems and some more options to configurate that galaxy. When done, you can download it as a plugin. Here is the link. <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/ES-GalaxyGenerator">https://github.com/zuckung/ES-GalaxyGenerator</a><br>

<blockquote>### automata.destruction.0percent

<br>

<br>

Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>

<br>

Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/27/14 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>

You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

<blockquote>### bunrodea.missions

<br>

<br>

This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>

<br>

Unlocking the planets is based on reputation, so you get access step by step. Unlocking the last of the planets(with the big shipyard) needs 500 reputation.<br>

<br>

Some missions from landing/spaceport unlock jobs. Others just give reputation or unlock story progression. Each job gives 5 to 40 reputation.<br>

Averagely you have to do like 50 jobs, less if you take the fighting jobs. Like in vanilla play, hit spaceport often.<br>

<br>

Since it's often questioned, here is a guide to the bunrodea first contact mission. Travel through Bunrodea territory till you've killed at least one Bunrodea ship, then fly to a human system, land there and you get a mission that mission brings you back to the Bunrodea. You can land on 4 planets now, and at this point this plugin starts.<br>

<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### capturable.person.ships

<br>

<br>

Makes person ships captureable.<br> 

<br>

<br>

Well, technically this plugin disables the person ships, and creates new ones which are captureable (with changed names to "<name> (disable me)", due to limitations of changing parts of the originals). Also adds all of them to the author government, adjusts some personalities and sets all frequencies to 1000. Changed "Tranquility" to have a weapon, so it doesn't flee. And changed "Zitchas" personality to "decloaked", so it doesn't flee and regenerate while cloaked.<br>

Attacking one of them makes all your enemies, they all try to disable instead of destroying, and they all have the same spawn chance which is in average within 10 minutes.<br>

<br>

At Earth's job board you can find a repeatable job that displays which persons you have already killed, which are alive, and where to find them.<br>

After you've killed them all, you receive a small unique gift.<br>

<br>

I tested this plugin with 10x KIV349, all equipped with Mereti beam weapons, was probably an overkill on most. Boarding "Zitchas"(1000 crew) needed an Echo-Galleon, and I tried it with hand2hand outfits plugin. Maybe it works with nerve gas too.<br>

In cap_persons.txt you find the following line under gamerules: "#	"person spawn period" 2000". If you remove the "#" the spawning speed is increased to one spawn in max a minute.<br>

<ul>

<li>"vyu-Ir" (not a person ship, but unique | found south-western of Gegno)</li>

<li>"Michael Zahniser" (found everywhere | Kestrel + Finch)</li>

<li>"Cap'n Pester" (found everywhere | Quarg Wardragon)</li>

<li>"Marauding Max" (found everywhere | Marauder Fury)</li>

<li>"Captain Nate" (found everywhere | Vanguard)</li>

<li>"Tranquility" (found everywhere | Lampyrid)</li>

<li>"Power of the People" (found everywhere | Modified Osprey)</li>

<li>"Local God" (found everywhere | Ursa Polaris)</li>

<li>"Subsidurial" (found in uninhabited | Subsidurial)</li>

<li>"Prototype B3-CC4" (found in Ember Waste | Shooting Star)</li>

<li>"Rais Iris XVIII" (found everywhere | Marauder Bactrian)</li>

<li>"Zitchas" (found in Ember Waste | Heron + Peregrine + 4x Petrel + 32x Tern)</li>

<li>"Brick" (found everywhere | 3x Modified Boxwing)</li>

<li>"Gefullte Taubenbrust" (found everywhere | Modified Battleship)</li>

<li>"MasterOfGrey" (found in Hai space | Modified Ladybug)</li>

<li>"Patrol Team" (found everywhere | 6x Waverider)</li>

<li>"Danau" (found in human space | 1x mod. Hauler IV, 2x Hauler III, 2x Hauler II, 2x Hauler)</li>

<br>

Adds all existing coalition outfitters and shipyards to 'Far Home'. Also adds a new shipyard and a new outfitter with missing ships/outfits.<br>

To start the mission to enable these outfitters and shipyards, you have to join Heliarch or Lunarium (complete the first chapter of these storylines) and own/pay 6/5 million credits. The mission starts anywhere in coalition space. I added this plausible mission to make the plugin feel less cheaty.<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds a station to the Sol system that offers administrative functions started by the job board. See the readme for details.<br>

<br>

Current functions:<br>

show reputation<br>

complete free worlds reconciliation campaign<br>

complete free worlds checkmate campaign<br>

complete free worlds both campaigns<br>

complete hai reveal 0 prolog<br>

<br>

Completing the campaigns might not exactly have the same result as if the campaign was played. There is a massive amount of events, that might suppress other events, when done on the same day. It looks good now, but not sure if that's really the case.<br>

So lets call this plugin EXPERIMENTAL for now.<br>

<blockquote>### expert.crew.members

<br>

<br>

Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>

<br>

Currently there are 95 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(1% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea(after first contact), Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to the Kor Efret), Gegno, Successor, Avgi(after first contact), Arachi, Kimek, Saryd(last 3 after coalition first contact).<br>

Their technology fields are: combat(10) cooling(10) energy(10) engine(10) fuel(10) hull(9) jamming(9) scanner(9) shield(9) storage(9).<br>

In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>

They have the positive stats of a small human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salary of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>

If you collect them all, you'll get a special mission.<br>

See <a href='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/expert.crew.members/crew.list.txt'>crew.list.txt</a> of this plugin for locations, and stat infos.<br>

<blockquote>### galactic.capital.investment <br>

<br>

Implements a short mission chain that enables repeatable job board investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space starting with 2 million credits cash and going up to 1 billion credits.<br>

<br>

At 1 billion credits cash a longer mission chain starts and enables a reapeatable job board investment of 1 billion credits. The chain has some breaks and finishes after a year.<br>

There is also a job to deposit and withdraw credits, but at a much lower interest rate. And the same job offers to deposit and withdraw to a family trust, which can be accessed by all your saves/pilots (but without interest).<br>

<br>

Job board investments:<br>

1 million = 274 credits daily (12% chance) (10% interest p.a.)<br>

5 million = 1,520 credits daily (10% chance) (11% interest p.a.)<br>

10 million = 3,287 credits daily (8% chance) (12% interest p.a.)<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds a new faction of Gegno pirates which lets you capture Gegno ships, gain Gegno/Scin/Vi reputation, open their planets for travel, loot Gegno licenses and create an outfitter/shipyard for all their gear.<br>

<br>

The new government "Gegno Pirates" (hidden till vanilla gegno story is done) inhabit the new System "Zaron"(between Huud, Vesvii and Cotpoxi). The surrounding systems, up to 3 jumps away, have new pirate fleets.<br>

Killing pirates and assisting Gegno/Scin/Vi gives reputation now. The needed reputation to land on the Gegno planets got changed to higher values. Killing like 80 Gegno pirates should allow you to land on all Gegno planets and use their shipyards and outfitters.<br>

Boarding Gegno Pirates gives you a 5% chance to obtain one of the 8 Gegno licenses.<br> 

After gaining full reputation for all planets and obtaining all Gegno licenses you get a mission to a new system with all outfitters/shipyards centralized.<br>

<br>

<br>

This plugin adds some casino space stations where you can gamble.<br>

<br>

Adds casino space stations to Ruchbah, Tarazed, Rutilicus, and Epsilon Leonis. On each station's job board you can start six luck based games (Baccarat, Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Craps, and Sic Bo).<br>

Every won round has a chance of increasing your skill for this special game. The skill levels go up to 500 which means you have a 5% higher chance of winning a round on max level. The games have different start winning chances from 47% to 50%.  I.e. with max poker skill, you have 55% chance to win a poker round. The table limits range from 5,000 to 100,000 credits and are randomized. After around 160 played rounds you get tired and the games ends (for this day).<br>

<blockquote>### jump.gates

<br>

<br>

Adds a ring of "jump gates" at the borders of Human space to create shortcuts inside the Human space.<br>

<br>

A month after the game starts, the player gets a spaceport info mission about a new discovered technology, that enables the building of jump gates (if your savegame is beyond that point, this info mission starts on the next planet landing). Over the next 5 months there are regularly spaceport info missions telling you things about how far the process of building these gates has come. At the end of this period all jump gates have been built and are usable.<br>

These jump gates are technically just wormholes with new sprites. The jump gate ring around human space is made of two gates in every of these systems: Naos (Deep) - Spica (Dirt Belt) - Alniyat (South) - Tarazed (South) - Sheratan (Core) - Alnitak (North) and from there back to Naos. Two gates, so you can move forward and backward on the ring.<br>

These images replace the boring vanilla images you see when you've landed on a planet with new, AI generated, better fitting ones. The old ones look like photos from earth or taken from public NASA archives(which they are). According to the description of the planets I tried to generate better fitting, more futuristic, more alien-looking images. And I think that went well :) <br>

In case parts of the UI/the buttons are outside the screen, try rescaling your UI in the ES options<br>

If that doesn't help, open the zip, edit 'landing.images.android/data/interface.txt' and change line 2 to 7 to:<br>

	image "land"

		center -60 -150

		dimensions 250 135

<br>

Planetary map travelling concept : Land on Memory, visit the outfitter and follow the small story line.<br>

<br>

This is just a proof of concept of an idea by Epsil-Astra.<br>

Basically a planet in a starsystem is a wormhole to a starsystem with changed background, to look like a ground map. The planets there look like cities. The galaxy background is a single whole planet. It simulates travelling on a planet you've landed on. Other starsystems act as different bioms, like forest, desert, sea.<br>

A small storyline got added.<br>

<br>

As in the spirit of Epsil-Astra, feel free to modify/use this plugin for your own content creation.<br>

<blockquote>### quarg.farm

<br>

<br>

Adds a new system "Saquerver" (between human and coalition space) where you can farm a new Quarg faction. Also the death sentence from all other Quarg got removed.<br>

<br>

The system "Saquerver" lies between "Serquergen" and "Ablub". The usual-sized Quarg fleets spawn there. Killing/plundering them doesn't make the other Quarg angry. Landing on the other Quarg faction's worlds doesn't end with a death sentence when you have their ships/outfits.<br>

<br>

<br>

Changelog:<br>

<br>

2025-01-27<br>

adjusted system "Saquerver" position to not collide with 0.10.11 additions<br>

<br>

2024-10-06<br>

removed death sentence from government "Quarg (Incipias)"<br>

<br>

<blockquote>### snowfeather.robotics <br>

<br>

<br>

Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>

Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>

<br>

To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' gives androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>

The new buyable worker androids are twice as expensive as the original ones, and pay off after like 4 years. Also 6 fighting androids are added, technically they are h2h outfits (with attack/defense 2/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12). To keep all androids close a new outfit category "Androids" was made.<br>
