# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small, modular and maximally compatible plugins that don't break vanilla lore too much. <br>

## Other things
<br>
<ul>
  <li>If you are familiar with Python, the scripts in the <a href="tools/README.md">tools-folder</a> might be interesting. There are a few to generate some of my plugins (to keep them up-to-date). And others like an ES jpg map creator or a PR files downloader</li>
  <li>If you want to run a plugin repository like this, download <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/plugin_repo_template.zip">plugin_repo_template.zip</a>. It has detailed instructions how to setup the repository.<br>
  Here are some repos made from the template:<br>

  <li>Furthermore, I'd like to present <a href="https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/">https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/</a> to other plugin creators or people who seek information inside the data folder. Basically it is a very fast way to view every object (root node) of the data folder on a website, especially when you don't know where to find something. For an easier browsing and comparing of game objects, like missions, ships, systems, and others.<br>

  <li>I've got another new project, a github repository that lets you online generate a galaxy with up to 500 star systems and some more options to configurate that galaxy. When done, you can download it as a plugin. Here is the link. <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/ES-GalaxyGenerator">https://github.com/zuckung/ES-GalaxyGenerator</a></li>

<blockquote>### additional.command.buttons <br>

<br>

Reworks the main buttons ui on the lower right side. Made for the ANDROID version of ES.<br> 

<br>

<br>

This plugin<br>

- rearranges and resizes some of the buttons<br>

- changes most icons (making a ring around as a standard)

- adds more permanent buttons from the radial menus to make them easy accessible<br>

- removes the radial menus<br>

- adds a new button row to the top right for the fleet commands<br>

- adds zoom buttons<br>

- adds more targeting buttons<br>

- greyes out inactive buttons<br>

- puts images behind the buttons, to grey out unavailable.<br>

- changes the ship hud<br>

<br>

merged the plugin landing.images.android:

Moves the landing image above the textbox, instead of behind the textbox.<br>

<br>

In case parts of the UI/the buttons are outside the screen, try rescaling your UI in the ES options<br>

If that doesn't help, open the zip, edit 'additional.command.buttons.radial/data/planet.txt' and change line 2 to 7 to:<br>

	image "land"

		center -60 -150

		dimensions 250 135

	sprite "ui/frame"

		center -60 -150

		dimensions 265 150

That resizes the landing image and the frame to their half.<br>

<br>

<blockquote>### automata.destruction.0percent

<br>

<br>

Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>

<br>

Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/27/14 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>

You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

<br>

Adds several new start options with different ships, background stories, credits and debts.<br>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Start: Trader | Freighter: equipped for cargo transport, in Merak system</li>

<li>Start: Trader (Hai) | Aphid: equipped for cargo transport, in Fah Soom system(Hai space)</li>

<li>Start: Passenger Transport | Scout: equipped for passenger transport, Talita system</li>

<li>Start: Miner | Sunder: equipped for mining, in Rasalhague system</li>

<li>Start: Salvager | Shuttle: equipped for boarding, in Aldhibain system</li>

<li>Start: Salvager(big) | Argosy: equipped for boarding, in Aldhibain system</li>

<li>Start: Explorer to Remnant | Heavy Shuttle: equipped for exploring the Remnant, in Tania Australis system</li>

<li>Start: Explorer to Automata | Bounder: equipped for exploring the Kor Automata, in Mirfak system</li>

<li>Start: Cheater | Squiddy + 20xSquiddyDrone: 10b credits, full visible human space, Jump Drive, in Sol system, no story</li>

</ul>

<br>

Beside the cheater start options, all others are balanced and lore friendly. A bigger ship means a bigger bank loan. All starts come with 200.000 credits cash and a bank loan between 600.000 and 4,5 million credits. The ships outfits are changed to fit the role. The intro missions on New Boston are set as completed. Same goes for the Hai start with the Hai first contact mission.<br>

<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### endgame<br>

<br>

A series of dungeon-like boss encounters for a single ship. With loottables and weapon upgrade mechanism.<br> 

<br>

<br>

This plugin is co-authored by "Unknown_Rawrs" who did ship balancing, outfit design & brainstorming.<br>

It is designed as an endgame farming spot to gather rare high-end outfits and weapon upgrades.<br>

<br>

A new wormhole opened in north of the Betelgeuse system and a new Navy station got build at its side. As soon as you land on the station you get a single "key" to enter the wormhole. That means only your flagship can enter. The encounters are designed to be played with a vanilla endgame heavy warship and the best vanilla outfits.<br>

In each of the systems on the other side of the wormhole, you encounter a single heavy warship that tries to kill you, with partly special mechanics. As soon as you win a fight, or a series if fights, the wormhole to the next system opens, and you are rewarded with credits and two items, randomly chosen from a loottable.<br>

There are some landable planet, so you can save, repair, and refuel after each enemy.<br>

Some of the loot items increase the stats for the next fight, others allow you to upgrade your vanilla weapons at the Republic station(in 3 stages, 133%/166%/200%).<br>

This plugin is intended to be experienced like a typical RPG dungeon. You face three bosses, loot them, then the next area is unlocked, 2 more bosses with better loot, and then you can face the endboss with best loot.<br>

<blockquote>### bunrodea.missions

<br>

<br>

This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>

<br>

Unlocking the planets is based on reputation, so you get access step by step. Unlocking the last of the planets(with the big shipyard) needs 500 reputation.<br>

<br>

Some missions from landing/spaceport unlock jobs. Others just give reputation or unlock story progression. Each job gives 5 to 40 reputation.<br>

Averagely you have to do like 50 jobs, less if you take the fighting jobs. Like in vanilla play, hit spaceport often.<br>

<br>

Since it's often questioned, here is a guide to the bunrodea first contact mission: Travel through Bunrodea territory till you've killed at least one Bunrodea ship, then fly to a human system (Misam works), land there and you get a mission, that brings you back to the Bunrodea. You can land on 4 planets now, and at this point this plugin starts.<br>

<br>

If the plugin control.station is installed, it gives additional information about the missions and shows this README.<br>

<br>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### capturable.person.ships

<br>

<br>

Makes person ships captureable.<br> 

<br>

<br>

Well, technically this plugin disables the person ships, and creates new ones which are captureable (with changed names to "<name> (C)", due to limitations of changing parts of the originals). Also adds all of them to the author government, adjusts some personalities and sets all frequencies to 1000. Changed "Tranquility" to have a weapon, so it doesn't flee. And changed "Zitchas" personality to "decloaked", so it doesn't flee and regenerate while cloaked.<br>

Attacking one of them makes all your enemies, they all try to disable instead of destroying, and they all have the same spawn chance which is in average 10 minutes.<br>

<br>

At Earth's job board you can find a repeatable job that displays which persons you have already killed, which are alive, and where to find them. If the plugin control.station is installed hou can find the list there, along with this readme.<br>

After you've killed them all, you receive a small unique gift.<br>

<br>

I tested this plugin with 10x KIV349, all equipped with Mereti beam weapons, was probably an overkill on most. Boarding "Zitchas"(1000 crew) needed an Echo-Galleon, and I tried it with hand2hand outfits plugin. Maybe it works with nerve gas too.<br>

In cap_persons.txt you find the following line under gamerules: "#	"person spawn period" 2000". If you remove the "#" the spawning speed is increased to one spawn in around half a minute.<br>

<ul>

<li>"vyu-Ir" (not a person ship, but unique | found south-western of Gegno)</li>

<li>"Michael Zahniser" (found everywhere | Kestrel + Finch)</li>

<li>"Cap'n Pester" (found everywhere | Quarg Wardragon)</li>

<br>

Adds all existing coalition outfitters and shipyards to 'Far Home'. Also adds a new shipyard and a new outfitter with missing ships/outfits.<br>

To start the mission to enable these outfitters and shipyards, you have to join Heliarch or Lunarium (complete the first chapter of these storylines) and own/pay 6/5 million credits. The mission starts anywhere in coalition space. I added this plausible mission to make the plugin feel less cheaty.<br>

<blockquote>### combat.ai

<br>

<br>

Offers a mission to install a combat AI, which increases your ship stats based on combat experience.<br>

<br>

You can get the mission to install the AI on any human planet.<br>

Every 3,000 combat xp you can choose between  9basic updates, every 7,000 between 11 advanced updates, and every 11,000 between 16 special updates.<br>

Some updates have max ranks and others can get raised infinitely. These updates are done by adding invisible outfits with stats to the ship.<br>

If you change your ship or lose the unique combat AI outfit, a restoring mission installs everything that has been lost on the (new) ship.<br>

Some mechanics and ideas are inspired by Zoura's excellent plugin "Tales of Apoxys DX" . My plugin is less complex, doesn't need a fresh start, and is more flexible.<br>

Install plugin control.station to get configuration options for this plugin, i.e. saved combat rating to start a new pilot with your saved combat.ai.<br>

<blockquote>### control.station

<br>

<br>

Adds a station to the Sol system that offers administrative functions started by the job board. See the readme for details.<br>

<br>

<br>

I am working on adding configuration and information for some of my plugins into this station.<br>

<br>

Current functions:<br>

info: Show Person Ship List (where you can find them and if they are alive or dead)<br>

info: City Ship License Guide<br>

info: Ship Capture Progression Guide<br>

ingo: Emerald Sword Guide<br>

QoL: Change Pilot Name (during a pilot's play, keep everything)<br>

QoL: Planet Attribute Visibility (expand planet's descriptions with the hidden attributes)<br>

QoL: Change Conditions (currently just a few popular ones)

Cheat: Reveal Whole Galaxy Map<br>

Cheat: set missions done: Free Worlds (choose between reconciliation, checkmate, or both)<br>

Cheat: set missions done: Hai Reveal (0 prolog)<br>

Cheat: set missions done: Remnant<br>

<br>

Completing the campaigns might not exactly have the same result as if the campaign was played. There is a massive amount of events, that might suppress other events, when done on the same day. It looks good now, but not sure if that's really the case. So lets call this function EXPERIMENTAL for now.<br>

<blockquote>### expert.crew.members

<br>

<br>

Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>

<br>

Currently there are 100 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(1% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea(after first contact), Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to the Kor Efret), Gegno, Successor, Avgi(after first contact), Incipias, Arachi, Kimek, Saryd(last 3 after coalition first contact).<br>

Their technology fields are: combat(10) cooling(10) energy(10) engine(10) fuel(10) hull(10) jamming(10) scanner(10) shield(9) storage(10).<br>

In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>

They have the positive stats of a small human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salary of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>

If you collect them all, you'll get a special mission.<br>

See <a href='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/expert.crew.members/crew.list.txt'>crew.list.txt</a> of this plugin for locations, and stat infos.<br>

<blockquote>### flare.play<br>

<br>

Adds lots of engine flare outfits to the big shipyards and outfitters. These outfits are just cosmetic. Idea by 'Thermognuclear Missile' on Discord.<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds a new outfitter with 262 cosmetic flare outfits to Wayfarer, Valhalla, Sunracer, Foundry and Solace. These flares get added to your normal engine flare. If your engine has a big flare and you add a tiny flare outfit, it is barely seen. Multiple flare outfits make the engine flare more intense. To use steering, reverse, or afterburner flares, your ship needs engine outfits with the regarding engine type. There are 155 vanilla flare outfits and 107 recolored flare outfits.<br>

Missions and events: On day 1 after plugin installation, a mission shows up, explaining the new flare outfits. After 30 days, all human fleets get a variant with flares; after 90 days, these fleets get another variant; and after 150 days they get the third variant.<br>

<blockquote>### galactic.capital.investment <br>

<br>

Implements a short mission chain that enables repeatable job board investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space starting with 2 million credits cash and going up to 1 billion credits.<br>

<br>

At 1 billion credits cash a longer mission chain starts and enables a reapeatable job board investment of 1 billion credits. The chain has some breaks and finishes after a year.<br>

There is also a job to deposit and withdraw credits, but at a much lower interest rate. And the same job offers to deposit and withdraw to a family trust, which can be accessed by all your saves/pilots (but without interest).<br>

<br>

Job board investments:(if enabled)<br>

1 million = 274 credits daily (12% chance) (10% interest p.a.)<br>

5 million = 1,520 credits daily (10% chance) (11% interest p.a.)<br>

10 million = 3,287 credits daily (8% chance) (12% interest p.a.)<br>

50 million = 17,808 credits daily (6% chance) (13% interest p.a.)<br>

100 million = 38,356 credits daily (4% chance) (14% interest p.a.)<br>

1 billion = 410,958 credits daily (2% chance) (15% interest p.a.)<br>

<br>

Job board bank account, always available:<br>

Deposit and withdraw from your bank account (4% interest p.a.)<br>

Deposit and withdraw from your family trust, accessible by all your pilots<br>

Sell investments at 10% conversion rate<br>

Set up the bank account interest as a daily cash payout<br>

Enable and disable the investment jobs/missions<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds a new faction of Gegno pirates which lets you capture Gegno ships, gain Gegno/Scin/Vi reputation, open their planets for travel, loot Gegno licenses and create an outfitter/shipyard for all their gear.<br>

<br>

The new government "Gegno Pirates" (hidden till vanilla gegno story is done) inhabit the new System "Zaron"(between Huud, Vesvii and Cotpoxi). The surrounding systems, up to 3 jumps away, have new pirate fleets.<br>

Killing pirates and assisting Gegno/Scin/Vi gives reputation now. The needed reputation to land on the Gegno planets got changed to higher values. Killing like 80 Gegno pirates should allow you to land on all Gegno planets and use their shipyards and outfitters.<br>

Boarding Gegno Pirates gives you a 5% chance to obtain one of the 8 Gegno licenses.<br> 

After gaining full reputation for all planets and obtaining all Gegno licenses you get a mission to a new system with all outfitters/shipyards centralized.<br>

<blockquote>### hai.side.mission.unlocker

<br>

<br>

Unlocks following hai missions: Unwanted Cargo Trigger, Hiding in Plain Sight and Hai Reveal: Pirate Troubles [0]. If there are followups they work too. Also Devil-Run related systems are shown now.<br>

<br>

Currently these missions are either completely blocked or blocked after you start chapter 1 of hai reveal. This plugin fixes that.<br>

mission "Unwanted Cargo Trigger" (removed secret leaks)<br>

mission "Unwanted Cargo" (removed secret leaks)<br>

mission "Hiding in Plain Sight" (removed secret leaks & resolution)<br>

mission "Hai Reveal: Pirate Troubles [0]" (Scars Legion cut out of campaign)<br>

<br>

Also removes the hidden tag from system Devil-Run. It can be found near the core and opens the path to the Deep Space systems and the Devil-Hide system via wormhole.<br>

And removes hidden tag from "Devil-Hide" and "Al Hurr", both Hai Reveal systems.<br>

<br>

<br>

<blockquote>### highrollers.ltd

<br>

<br>

This plugin adds some casino space stations where you can gamble.<br>

<br>

Adds casino space stations to Ruchbah, Tarazed, Rutilicus, and Epsilon Leonis. On each station's job board you can start six luck based games (Baccarat, Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Craps, and Sic Bo).<br>

Every won round has a chance of increasing your skill for this special game. The skill levels go up to 500 which means you have a 5% higher chance of winning a round on max level. The games have different start winning chances from 47% to 50%.  I.e. with max poker skill, you have 55% chance to win a poker round. The table limits range from 5,000 to 100,000 credits and are randomized. After around 160 played rounds you get tired and the games ends (for this day).<br>

<blockquote>### jump.gates

<br>

<br>

Adds a ring of "jump gates" at the borders of Human space to create shortcuts inside the Human space.<br>

<br>

A month after the game starts, the player gets a spaceport info mission about a new discovered technology, that enables the building of jump gates (if your savegame is beyond that point, this info mission starts on the next planet landing). Over the next 5 months there are regularly spaceport info missions telling you things about how far the process of building these gates has come. At the end of this period all jump gates have been built and are usable.<br>

These jump gates are technically just wormholes with new sprites. The jump gate ring around human space is made of two gates in every of these systems: Naos (Deep) - Spica (Dirt Belt) - Alniyat (South) - Tarazed (South) - Sheratan (Core) - Alnitak (North) and from there back to Naos. Two gates, so you can move forward and backward on the ring.<br>

>Adds lots of repeatable boarding and assisting missions for different factions. Boarding bigger ships give higher rewards or higher chances for credits or special items. See the README for details.

<details>

<blockquote>### more.boarding.missions <br>

<br>

<br>

Bigger ships give higher rewards.<br>

<br>

Only natural spawning ships can trigger these missions and ships spawned from jobs/missions or marauder hunting fleets doesn't trigger. Remnant assisting chances and Ka'het boarding chances are so high, cause of the rarity to find a boardable ship.<br>

Replaces Cluster Mine Layer, Cluster Mine Racks and Cluster Mines with Husk-Slice and Shield Disruptor guns, and if need be Heat Shunts, on Model 16/32/64/128/256/512. For every removed mine layer guns and heat shunts got added. That increases game performance in mass fights, like in Mesuket system.<br>

<br>

This is a storyline entirely on a planets surface(with fitting visuals). Available at the outfitter on planet Memory.<br>

<br>

This is a proof of concept of an idea by Epsil-Astra.<br>

Basically a planet in a starsystem is a wormhole to a starsystem with changed background, to look like a ground map. The planets there look like cities. The galaxy background is a single whole planet. It simulates travelling on a planet you've landed on. Other starsystems act as different bioms, like forest, desert, sea.<br>

Beside showing the concept there is a storyline, 9 cities/outpost, 9 areas with 3 different bioms.<br>

<blockquote>### quarg.farm

<br>

<br>

Adds a new system "Saquerver" (between human and coalition space) where you can farm a new Quarg faction. Also the death sentence from all other Quarg got removed.<br>

<br>

The system "Saquerver" lies between "Serquergen" and "Ablub". The usual-sized Quarg fleets spawn there. Killing/plundering them doesn't make the other Quarg angry. Landing on the other Quarg faction's worlds doesn't end with a death sentence when you have their ships/outfits.<br>

<blockquote>### ship.merging

<br>

<br>

This plugin allows you to merge several ships of the same type into one with improved attributes. This can be done several times, up to a T10 ship.<br>

<br>

There is a new landable alien ship in the new "Dent" system (near the wormhole to the Hai). There you can merge a ship and 3 base versions of that ship into a T1 ship with doubled attributes. Or 3 base versions and a T1 into a T2 with trippled stats. This goes up to T10 ships with 11 times the attributes. Basically you can reduce the amount of ships in your fleet. With 10x T10 ships you have the firepower and other stats of 110 ships of that type, while paying with 310 ships for it. Not cheap, but effective.<br>

Reduce performance issues by reducing ship amounts or just make single ships more powerful. This plugin makes it possible.<br>

(idea by unknown_rawrs)<br>

<blockquote>### snowfeather.robotics <br>

<br>

<br>

Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>

Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>

<br>

To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' gives androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>

The new buyable worker androids are twice as expensive as the original ones, and pay off after like 4 years. Also 6 fighting androids are added, technically they are h2h outfits (with attack/defense 2/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12). To keep all androids close a new outfit category "Androids" was made.<br>
